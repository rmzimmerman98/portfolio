            I've lived in Las Vegas for most of my life, until somewhat recently moving to East Tennessee. <br><br>
            For most of my day, I enjoy reading, video games, and either playing or DMing a session of Dungeons and Dragons.<br><br> 
            As for why I got into software engineering, that gaming had me interested in what all could be accomplished through a technological medium. I took some classes in high school for the very basics, and now years later, some friends of mine sparked my interest, and here I am again.

        <!-- <p>
            Not quite sure what I'm going to do here, especially since I have no resume. Probably some loren ipsum text in a picture, some kind of slide reveal? I'll figure it out later

            And the potential carousel goes here. I'll make it a list at first, maybe make a funny little link that leads back to the home page. Idk, we'll see.
