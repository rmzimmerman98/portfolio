    <div class="home">
        <p>
            The home page of this whole shindig. I'll fill this out with info later, but for now, this is just a test drive.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>
            And this is the test paragraph for the bio. Not quite sure what I'll put here, I'm nowhere near that interesting, but I'll figure it out.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="resume">
        <p>
            Not quite sure what I'm going to do here, especially since I have no resume. Probably some loren ipsum text in a picture, some kind of slide reveal? I'll figure it out later
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="projects">
        <p>
            And the potential carousel goes here. I'll make it a list at first, maybe make a funny little link that leads back to the home page. Idk, we'll see.
